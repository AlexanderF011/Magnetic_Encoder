# Magnetic_Encoder
Includes test code for the AEAT-6600-T16 magnetic encoder. Written with the intention of using the encoder for a Surveyor's Wheel.

The microcontroller of choice for this project was the Arduino UNO R3. Maybe be modified in the future to work with the TM4C123G launchpad. 

References two GitHub repositories created by Andrew Becker(4nswer) and GitHub user i-make-robots, as well as code from a public forum that Becker linked.
